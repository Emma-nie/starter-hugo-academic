abstract: Push-out tests were conducted on 15 groups of symmetric timber-timber
  composite (TTC) joints with coach screw shear connectors. The push-out test
  results were used to characterise load-slip, peak load carrying capacity and
  failure mode of the composite shear connection between timber slab made of
  cross laminated timber (CLT) and timber beams/joists made of laminated veneer
  lumber (LVL) and/or glued laminated timber (GLT). Effect of coach screw size,
  type of engineered wood product (i.e. LVL-to-CLT and/or GLT-to-CLT), GLT
  grade, thickness of the CLT slab and orientation of load with respect to the
  outermost layer of CLT on the structural behaviour of the TTC joints were
  studied. In addition to the TTC connection tests, embedment strength of the
  LVL, CLT and GLT and bending yield strength of the screws were experimentally
  determined and the results were incorporated into a versatile nonlinear beam
  on inelastic foundation finite element (FE) model to capture the full range
  load-slip response of the TTC connection. The nonlinear FE models (including
  material and geometrical nonlinearities) were validated against the test data
  produced in this study and available in the literature and it was shown that
  the proposed nonlinear FE model can accurately predict the load-slip,
  stiffness and peak load carrying capacity of the TTC joints with screw shear
  connectors. The ultimate strength of the TTC joints were also estimated by
  modified European yield model (EYM) and comparison of the experimental peak
  load with EYM and FE predictions demonstrated the significant influence of the
  rope effect on the full range load-slip response and ultimate load carrying
  capacity of the TTC joints with dowel shear connectors.
